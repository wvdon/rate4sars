## The meta-analysis on evolution of SARS-CoV-2
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 three years ago, various countries have set different epidemic prevention policies. For human health, the scientific community has also made great efforts. With the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the policy adjustment of human society, our attitudes towards it have also changed. Based on our previous study about the dynamics of binding ability prediction between spike protein and human ACE2, this study mined over 10 million sequence and epidemiological data of SARS-CoV-2 during 2020-2022. We analyzed and predicted the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations to make a preliminary disclosure of the relationship between human beings and COVID-19, moreover, provide a scientific basis for raising appropriate strategies to confront human pathogens in the long run.
